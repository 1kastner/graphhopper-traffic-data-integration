# GraphHopper Traffic Data Integration

This project allows you to influence the routing via posting a JSON over HTTP.
The simplest use case is to post data with traffic information like the speed of the vehicles.
The nice thing is that the routing will change immediately after posting the data, i.e. in real time.

When using the speed mode (prepare.chWeighting=fastest) real time is not possible for large areas as you'll have to 
prepare the data again after new data arrived which will take roughly 9 minutes for Germany. So only near-real-time.

# Start

Start the server for your area:

 * ./td.sh datasource=your-osm-file.pbf
 * visit http://localhost:8989 to try routing in our UI

Now feed some data and try routing again:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @traffic.json http://localhost:8989/datafeed
```

Note, in order to use the provided example `traffic.json` you'll have to use the specific area, get it 
[here](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen/duesseldorf-regbez-latest.osm.pbf)

# Data Format

The data format is very generic and can be used for other information influencing routing:

```json
[{
   "id": "1",
   "points": [[6.827273, 51.190264]],
   "value": 10,
   "value_type": "speed",
   "mode": "REPLACE"
}, {
   "id": "somethingelse",
   "points": ...
}
]
```

Note, the point list is in geo json and therefor use lon,lat instead of the more common lat,lon order
